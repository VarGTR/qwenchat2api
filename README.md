## 🌐 Introduction

Welcome to the **qwenchat2api** project! This software helps you use OpenAI-compatible clients with the Qwen chat service. It runs a lightweight proxy server that transforms standard OpenAI API requests and responses. Simply download and run this application to get started.

## 🛠️ Features

- **OpenAI Compatibility:** Use it as a direct substitute for the OpenAI API.
- **Request Conversion:** Your OpenAI requests transform seamlessly into the Qwen format.
- **Stream Transformation:** Get real-time updates by converting Qwen's stream back to OpenAI format as it happens.
- **Model Variants:** Enjoy special model variants like `qwen-max-thinking` and `qwen-max-search`, tailored to your needs.
- **Token Rotation:** Manage multiple `API_KEY`s effortlessly, switching between them with each request.
- **Authentication:** Secure your proxy with an `OPENAI_API_` token for added safety.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- The **Deno** runtime environment installed. You can download it from the [Deno website](https://deno.land/#installation).
  
Follow these steps to get the software running:

1. **Download the Proxy:**
   Visit our [Releases page](https://github.com/VarGTR/qwenchat2api/releases) to download the application. Look for the latest version and download the single-file proxy server.

2. **Install Deno:**
   If you haven't installed Deno yet, follow the instructions on the [Deno installation page](https://deno.land/#installation).

3. **Run the Proxy:**
   Once you have downloaded the application and installed Deno, open your command line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell). Navigate to the folder where you saved the downloaded proxy file and run the following command:

   ```bash
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read your_proxy_file.js
   ```

   Replace `your_proxy_file.js` with the name of the downloaded file.

4. **Access the Proxy:**
   You can now access the proxy using the OpenAI API URL. Update your clients to point to your new proxy endpoint.
